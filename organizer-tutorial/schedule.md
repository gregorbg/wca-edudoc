# Organizer's Guide

## Creating a great competition schedule

The schedule of your competition will be the driving force for your general workflow and tasks.
It is very important to have a good schedule that works out for multiple reasons.

1. You make sure that everything runs smoothly on the competition day(s). With an efficient schedule, you will have the feeling that running the competition "just works".
2. The competitors will always be informed and up-to-date on the events that they are competing in. You will avoid running into trouble with late competitors that do not turn up when being called.
3. Keeping to your schedule helps to reduce stress tremendously, and will make the organisation team less exhausted. You will have a more pleasant time working together during the weekend.

## Vocabulary

- **Do** is a guideline that should always be followed. If there are circumstances that cause you to break a **Do**, then you should rethink and try to avoid these circumstances at all costs.
- **Consider** guidelines should generally be followed. There are reasons to deviate from these points, but only if you understand the meaning behind the original guideline.
- **Avoid** means that something should not be done at all. If you observe one of these anti-patterns in your own schedule, you should go back to the drawing board.
- **Why?** indications are sometimes provided to explain a guideline or provide reasoning for another item in this list.

## Decide the purpose of the competition

Do decide which events should be held during the competition.
- Are you focusing on a particular set of "main events"?
- Are you intending to offer a broad range of events with only a small number of rounds each?
- Is your competition tailored towards newcomers, with the typical "kids pack" of events?

Do decide how many days the competition will be.

Consider the approximate size of the competition, in terms of a competitor limit.

Why? Having a clear vision in mind for the objectives of your competition helps to streamline the event as a whole.

Why? Knowing the size of the competition is imperative for determining the duration of rounds and events.

## Decide the time frame of the competition

Do know what time you can arrive at the venue.
- Will you have the opportunity to set up stations and timers the evening/night before?

Do know what time you must leave the venue by.

Do decide an appropriate starting time for the competition.
- Are competitors arriving from the region, or do you have a lot of (inter-)national visitors?
- How well accessible is the venue? Can everyone reach you easily in the city center or are you in a remote location that takes time to arrive?

Consider having extra time in the morning for setup and staff briefings.
- Have you worked with the organisers before?
- Are you so well-acquainted that you trust they will carry out their tasks without prior instructions?

Consider having extra buffer time in the afternoon, as a buffer in case the competition runs behind.

Avoid starting a day too early before a normal business day would start.
- Operation hours for public transport align with working hours in most countries
- People need time for their morning routine and a good breakfast before getting to the venue

Avoid having a day length that is longer than any usual workday.
- Include enough time for short intermediate breaks to regain focus
- Include a reasonably long lunch break, so that people can get food and replenish

Why? It is important to determine the total amount of time that is available for competing. Only then can you start to assign the events to time slots.

Why? A competition that is too long can easily become exhausting for the Delegate, organisers, staff and even competitors. Packing as many events as possible will not create a fun atmosphere and will only tire everybody out
